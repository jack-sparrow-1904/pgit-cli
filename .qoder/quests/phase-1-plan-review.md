# PGit CLI Production Readiness Implementation Design

## Overview

This design document outlines the technical implementation strategy to transform the PGit CLI from a development-ready tool into a production-grade open source package. The implementation focuses on establishing automated CI/CD pipelines, package publishing workflows, and comprehensive documentation to support enterprise adoption.

### Project Context

PGit CLI is a specialized tool solving the critical problem of private file version control in team environments. It uses a dual repository architecture where private files are stored in an isolated `.git-pgit` repository while maintaining accessibility through symbolic links at their original locations.

**Core Architecture Pattern:**
```
Project Root/
├── .git/                    # Main team repository
├── .git-pgit/               # Isolated private repository
├── .pgit-storage/           # Physical private file storage
│   ├── .env
│   └── secrets.json
├── .env                     # → symlink to .pgit-storage/.env
└── secrets.json             # → symlink to .pgit-storage/secrets.json
```

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Complete CLI functionality with 6 core commands
- ✅ Cross-platform symbolic link management
- ✅ TypeScript architecture with >90% test coverage
- ✅ Modular service architecture (config, git, filesystem, symlink)
- ❌ Missing production infrastructure (CI/CD, publishing, documentation)

## Architecture

### Technology Stack Analysis

The current technology stack is production-ready with modern tooling and appropriate dependency choices:

**Runtime Dependencies:**
- `commander@^11.0.0` - Mature CLI framework with excellent API design
- `chalk@^4.1.2` - Terminal styling with broad compatibility
- `fs-extra@^11.1.0` - Enhanced filesystem operations for cross-platform support
- `simple-git@^3.19.0` - Git operations abstraction
- `zod@^3.22.0` - Runtime schema validation for configuration management

**Development Infrastructure:**
- TypeScript 5.0+ for type safety and modern language features
- Jest 29+ for comprehensive testing with high coverage
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality enforcement
- Node.js 18+ requirement ensures modern runtime features

### CLI Architecture Pattern

The implementation follows a layered architecture separating concerns:

```mermaid
graph TD
    CLI[CLI Layer - cli.ts] --> CMD[Command Layer]
    CMD --> CORE[Core Services]
    CORE --> UTILS[Utilities]
    
    subgraph "Command Layer"
        INIT[init.command.ts]
        ADD[add.command.ts]
        STATUS[status.command.ts]
        COMMIT[commit.command.ts]
        CLEANUP[cleanup.command.ts]
        GITOPS[gitops.command.ts]
    end
    
    subgraph "Core Services"
        CONFIG[ConfigManager]
        GIT[GitService]
        SYMLINK[SymlinkService]
        FS[FilesystemService]
    end
    
    subgraph "Utilities"
        PLATFORM[PlatformDetector]
        EXECUTOR[CommandExecutor]
        VALIDATOR[InputValidator]
        PROGRESS[ProgressService]
    end
```

**Component Responsibilities:**
- **CLI Layer**: Command parsing, argument validation, output formatting
- **Command Layer**: Business logic implementation for each CLI command
- **Core Services**: Platform-agnostic business operations
- **Utilities**: Cross-cutting concerns and platform-specific adaptations

### Command Interface Design

The CLI exposes 6 primary commands with clear separation of concerns:

| Command | Function | Core Services Used |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| `pgit init` | Initialize dual repository structure | ConfigManager, GitService, FilesystemService |
| `pgit add <paths>` | Add files to private tracking | SymlinkService, GitService, FilesystemService |
| `pgit status` | Show repository status | GitService, ConfigManager |
| `pgit commit` | Commit private repository changes | GitService |
| `pgit cleanup` | Repair inconsistent state | All core services |
| `pgit gitops` | Execute git operations on private repo | GitService |

### Error Handling Architecture

The error system provides structured error handling with context preservation:

```mermaid
graph TD
    BASE[BaseError] --> FS[FilesystemError]
    BASE --> GIT[GitError]
    BASE --> SYMLINK[SymlinkError]
    BASE --> CONFIG[ConfigError]
    
    HANDLER[EnhancedErrorHandler] --> BASE
    
    subgraph "Error Context"
        OPERATION[Operation Context]
        PLATFORM[Platform Info]
        STACKTRACE[Stack Trace]
        SUGGESTIONS[Recovery Suggestions]
    end
```

**Error Categories:**
- **FilesystemError**: File/directory operation failures
- **GitError**: Git command execution failures
- **SymlinkError**: Symbolic link creation/management issues
- **ConfigError**: Configuration validation and management errors

### Cross-Platform Implementation

Platform-specific behaviors are abstracted through the PlatformDetector utility:

**Symbolic Link Support Matrix:**
- **macOS/Linux**: Native `ln -s` support
- **Windows**: Requires Developer Mode or Administrator privileges
- **Fallback**: Hard links where symbolic links unavailable

**File System Considerations:**
- Path separator normalization
- Permission handling across platforms
- Case sensitivity variations

## CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

### Multi-Stage Pipeline Design

The CI/CD implementation uses a three-stage approach optimized for reliability and security:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PR[Pull Request] --> CI[CI Pipeline]
    PUSH[Push to main] --> CI
    TAG[Version Tag] --> RELEASE[Release Pipeline]
    
    CI --> BUILD[Build & Test]
    CI --> SECURITY[Security Scan]
    CI --> QUALITY[Quality Check]
    
    BUILD --> TEST_MATRIX[Cross-Platform Tests]
    TEST_MATRIX --> UBUNTU[Ubuntu 20.04/22.04]
    TEST_MATRIX --> MACOS[macOS 12/13]
    TEST_MATRIX --> WINDOWS[Windows 2019/2022]
    
    SECURITY --> AUDIT[npm audit]
    SECURITY --> CODEQL[CodeQL Analysis]
    SECURITY --> DEPS[Dependency Review]
    
    QUALITY --> LINT[ESLint]
    QUALITY --> FORMAT[Prettier]
    QUALITY --> COVERAGE[Coverage Report]
    
    RELEASE --> CHANGELOG[Generate Changelog]
    RELEASE --> NPM[Publish to NPM]
    RELEASE --> GITHUB[GitHub Release]
```

### CI Workflow Specification

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Pull requests to main/develop branches
- Direct pushes to main branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Node.js Testing Matrix:**
- Node.js versions: 18.x, 20.x, 22.x
- Operating systems: ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest
- Package managers: npm (primary), yarn (compatibility)

**Quality Gates:**
- TypeScript compilation must succeed
- ESLint must pass with zero errors
- Prettier formatting must be correct
- Jest tests must achieve >90% coverage
- All tests must pass on all platforms

### Security Pipeline

**Vulnerability Scanning:**
- `npm audit` for dependency vulnerabilities
- GitHub Security Advisories integration
- Automatic security updates via Dependabot

**Code Quality Analysis:**
- CodeQL for JavaScript/TypeScript analysis
- SARIF report generation for security findings
- Dependency license compliance checking

### Release Automation

**Release Triggers:**
- Git tags matching pattern `v*.*.*`
- Manual release workflow dispatch
- Automated releases on main branch (configurable)

**Release Artifacts:**
- NPM package published to npmjs.org
- GitHub release with changelog
- Cross-platform binary distributions (future)
- Documentation updates

## Release Management Strategy

### Semantic Versioning Implementation

The release management follows strict semantic versioning with automated tooling:

**Version Increment Rules:**
- **MAJOR (X.0.0)**: Breaking API changes, CLI interface changes
- **MINOR (x.Y.0)**: New features, new commands, backward-compatible changes
- **PATCH (x.y.Z)**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, dependency updates

### Conventional Commits Integration

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Supported Types:**
- `feat`: New features → MINOR version bump
- `fix`: Bug fixes → PATCH version bump
- `docs`: Documentation → PATCH version bump
- `style`: Formatting changes → PATCH version bump
- `refactor`: Code restructuring → PATCH version bump
- `test`: Test additions → PATCH version bump
- `chore`: Maintenance → PATCH version bump
- `BREAKING CHANGE`: → MAJOR version bump

### Automated Release Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant PR as Pull Request
    participant Main as Main Branch
    participant Release as Release System
    participant NPM as NPM Registry
    
    Dev->>PR: Create PR with conventional commits
    PR->>PR: Run CI tests
    PR->>Main: Merge after approval
    Main->>Release: Trigger release workflow
    Release->>Release: Analyze commits for version bump
    Release->>Release: Generate changelog
    Release->>Release: Create git tag
    Release->>NPM: Publish package
    Release->>Main: Update package.json version
```

### Release Configuration

**Release-it Configuration (.release-it.json):**

    "CHANGELOG.md",
    "package.json"
  ],
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0",
    "npm": ">=8.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Distribution Strategy

**Installation Methods:**
1. **Global CLI Installation**: `npm install -g @private-git/cli`
2. **Temporary Usage**: `npx @private-git/cli init`
3. **Project Dependency**: `npm install --save-dev @private-git/cli`
4. **Yarn Alternative**: `yarn global add @private-git/cli`

**Package Size Optimization:**
- Include only essential files via `files` array
- Exclude development artifacts (.ts files, tests)
- Minimize dependency footprint
- Compress distribution assets

### Binary Distribution

**CLI Entry Point Configuration:**
```json
{
  "bin": {
    "pgit": "./dist/cli.js"
  }
}
```

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- Shebang line for Unix systems: `#!/usr/bin/env node`
- Windows compatibility through npm's binary wrapper
- Executable permissions handled by npm install process

## Documentation Architecture

### Open Source Documentation Framework

The documentation strategy ensures comprehensive coverage for contributors and users:

**Essential Documentation Files:**

| Document | Purpose | Content Strategy |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| LICENSE | Legal framework | MIT License for maximum compatibility |
| CONTRIBUTING.md | Developer onboarding | Setup, standards, PR process |
| CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md | Community standards | Contributor Covenant v2.1 |
| SECURITY.md | Vulnerability reporting | Responsible disclosure process |
| CHANGELOG.md | Release history | Automated from conventional commits |

### GitHub Repository Templates

**Issue Templates:**

```markdown
## Bug Report Template
- **System Information**: OS, Node.js version, npm version
- **PGit Version**: Output of `pgit --version`

## Security Architecture

### Application Security Model

**Core Security Principles:**
- **Local-Only Operations**: No network requests or data transmission
- **Repository Isolation**: Complete separation between main and private repositories
- **Minimal Privilege**: Operations use least-required permissions
- **Transparent Operations**: All file system changes are explicitly logged

**Threat Model Analysis:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    THREATS[Security Threats] --> FILE_LEAK[Private File Exposure]
    THREATS --> REPO_CORRUPTION[Repository Corruption]
    THREATS --> SUPPLY_CHAIN[Supply Chain Attack]
    THREATS --> PRIVILEGE_ESC[Privilege Escalation]
    
    FILE_LEAK --> ISOLATION[Repository Isolation]
    REPO_CORRUPTION --> VALIDATION[Input Validation]
    SUPPLY_CHAIN --> AUDIT[Dependency Auditing]
    PRIVILEGE_ESC --> LEAST_PRIV[Minimal Permissions]
    
    ISOLATION --> SECURE_LINKS[Secure Symlink Handling]
    VALIDATION --> ZOD_SCHEMA[Zod Schema Validation]
    AUDIT --> AUTOMATED_SCAN[Automated Security Scanning]
    LEAST_PRIV --> PLATFORM_DETECT[Platform-Specific Permissions]
```

### Cross-Platform Security Considerations

**Platform-Specific Security Features:**

| Platform | Security Constraints | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Windows** | Admin privileges for symlinks | Developer Mode detection, graceful fallback |
| **macOS** | Gatekeeper restrictions | Code signing (future), clear user guidance |
| **Linux** | File permission variations | Comprehensive permission checking |

**Symbolic Link Security:**
- Prevent symlink traversal attacks
- Validate target paths before creation
- Check for existing symlinks before overwriting
- Platform-specific permission verification

### Supply Chain Security

**Dependency Management:**
- Minimal dependency surface (5 runtime dependencies)
- Regular automated security audits
- Dependency license compliance
- Automated vulnerability patching via Dependabot

**Package Integrity:**
- NPM provenance attestation for build transparency
- Package signing for distribution integrity
- Reproducible builds for verification
- SLSA compliance (future enhancement)

### Vulnerability Response Process

**Security Disclosure:**
1. Private security advisory creation
2. Coordinated vulnerability disclosure (90-day timeline)
3. Patch development and testing
4. Security release with advisory publication
5. Post-incident analysis and process improvement

## Testing Strategy
